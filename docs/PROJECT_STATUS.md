## ðŸš§ Current Phase: Ready for Phase 3

### Phase 3: ML Anomaly Detection (0% Complete)
**Status**: ðŸš§ Ready to Start  
**Target Start**: Immediate

**Planned Tasks**:
1. **Phase 3.1**: ML Model Development - Anomaly detection algorithms
2. **Phase 3.2**: Model Training - Historical data analysis and training
3. **Phase 3.3**: Integration - ML pipeline with monitoring stack
4. **Phase 3.4**: Auto-Remediation - Automated response to anomalies

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements Adherence

### âœ… Zero-Cost Implementation
- Using GitHub Student Pack benefits
- AWS Free Tier eligible infrastructure
- Open-source tools and technologies

### âœ… No Mock Data Policy
- All configurations use real, production-ready settings
- Placeholder values clearly marked for user input
