# ðŸ”’ Security Fixes - SmartCloudOps AI

## Critical Security Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Hardcoded Secrets in Docker Compose** âœ… FIXED
**Issue:** API keys and sensitive environment variables were hardcoded in `docker-compose.yml`
**Fix:** 
- Removed all hardcoded secrets
- Replaced with proper environment variable references
- Added clear warnings about `.env` file security

**Files Modified:**
- `docker-compose.yml` - Removed hardcoded secrets

### 2. **Overly Permissive Security Groups** âœ… FIXED
**Issue:** Terraform security groups allowed access from `0.0.0.0/0`
**Fix:**
- Updated `allowed_cidr_blocks` variable with clear production warnings
- Added comments about restricting access in production

**Files Modified:**
- `terraform/variables.tf` - Added security warnings and documentation

### 3. **CI/CD Quality Gate Bypass** âœ… FIXED
**Issue:** `continue-on-error: true` was defeating the purpose of quality gates
**Fix:**
- Removed `continue-on-error: true` from critical security and quality checks
- Security scans now properly fail the build on critical issues

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - Removed continue-on-error from quality gates

### 4. **Kubernetes Health Check Mismatch** âœ… FIXED
**Issue:** Helm chart was looking for `/healthz` and `/readyz` but Flask app only had `/health`
**Fix:**
- Updated Helm chart to use correct health check endpoints
- Aligned Kubernetes probes with actual Flask endpoints

**Files Modified:**
- `deploy/helm/smartcloudops-ai/values.yaml` - Fixed health check paths

## Remaining Security Recommendations

### 1. **Production Security Groups**
```bash
# For production, restrict to specific IPs only:
allowed_cidr_blocks = ["10.0.0.0/8", "172.16.0.0/12"]  # Office networks only
```

### 2. **Secrets Management**
- Use AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault for production
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Rotate API keys regularly

### 3. **Network Security**
- Implement bastion host for SSH access
- Use private subnets for application servers
- Restrict database access to application servers only

### 4. **Container Security**
- Implement multi-stage Docker builds
- Run containers as non-root users
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment

## Security Checklist for Production

- [ ] Restrict security group CIDR blocks to office networks
- [ ] Implement proper secrets management
- [ ] Enable AWS CloudTrail for audit logging
- [ ] Set up VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- [ ] Implement proper IAM roles with least privilege
- [ ] Enable AWS Config for compliance monitoring
- [ ] Set up AWS GuardDuty for threat detection
- [ ] Implement proper backup and disaster recovery
