## [Unreleased]

## [Phase 6.1] - 2025-08-12

### Fixed
- **Integration Test Failure**: Fixed error handling in anomaly detection workflow
- **Input Validation**: Enhanced error responses for invalid input data (400 vs 500 status codes)
- **Security Enhancement**: Improved input validation and error handling for anomaly detection endpoint
- **Test Coverage**: All 161 tests now pass (158 passed, 3 skipped)

### Verified
- **All 6 Phases Complete**: Comprehensive verification of all phase functionality
- **Infrastructure Status**: 2 AWS EC2 instances confirmed running (44.244.231.27, 35.92.147.156)
- **Dependencies**: All Python packages verified and functional in virtual environment
- **Production Readiness**: Application ready for Phase 7 implementation

### Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Better validation error responses in ML endpoints
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Verified all components working correctly before Phase 7

## [Phase 6.0] - 2025-08-09

### Added
- **Phase 4 Readiness Checklist**: Comprehensive documentation of Phase 4 preparation
- **Enhanced ML Model Training**: Improved model training with real data only
- **Production-Ready Data Pipeline**: Removed all synthetic data fallbacks from production code

### Fixed
- **Test Failures**: Fixed 3 failing tests (AI handler, data processor, model trainer)
- **Synthetic Data Cleanup**: Removed synthetic data fallbacks from production ML pipeline
- **Configuration Issues**: Fixed hardcoded Prometheus URLs and configuration mismatches
- **Model Training**: Enhanced error handling and validation for real data scenarios

### Changed
- **Data Processing**: Now requires real Prometheus data instead of falling back to synthetic data
- **Model Validation**: Removed synthetic anomaly generation from validation process
- **Error Handling**: Improved error messages and handling for production scenarios
